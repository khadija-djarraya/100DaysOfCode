# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 9th, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Solved 2 Python Hackerrank problems in one hour, brainstormed the goal of my 100 days of code challenge.

**Thoughts:** I wanted to improve my problem solving skills, apply my machine learning knowledge into a project, and I also wanted to create a personal portfolio. After alot of thinking I solved this dilemma and decided to create a personal portfolio as it will allow me to develop small embedded projects to practice and showcase my skills.
