# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 9th, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: 

Solved 2 Python Hackerrank problems in one hour, brainstormed the goal of my 100 days of code challenge.

**Thoughts:** 

I wanted to improve my problem solving skills, apply my machine learning knowledge into a project, and I also wanted to create a personal portfolio. After alot of thinking I solved this dilemma and decided to create the outline of my portfolio as it will allow me to have an overall idea on what I want to build, and incite myself to develop small embedded projects to use to showcase my ML skills.

### Day 1: July 10th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Started my VueJS front-end project locally, and brainstormed on the appearance of my website using multiple references, until reaching a final idea.

### Day 2: July 11th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Created this repository to monitor my work. further developed the homepage and the navbar.

### Day 3: July 13th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Completed Datacamp's course on Deep Learning. Started mini-projects in Artificial Intelligence to add in my portfolio. I used FreeCodeCamp's resources of their machine learning course.

**Thoughts**:  

I have faced some struggles when I started applying my theoretical knowledge of AI into my first project "Rock Paper Scissors". But I hope I get the hang of it soon.

### Day 4: July 15th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

I tried working on the first project on freecodecamp's machine learning course "Rock Paper Scissors" but I only reached the following results:

Player 1: Winning rate 100%

Player 2: Winning rate 50%

Player 3: Winning rate 50%

Player 4: Winning rate 84%

(Requirements for completion: A minimum of 60% for each)

I have tried to find a way to solve this problem but I did not figure it out yet. As I was starting to lack productivity, I decided to look at another project within that course. I decided to go for "Predicting health costs" project, and started working on it!

### Day 5: July 16th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Successfully completed the project "Predicting health costs"!

**Thoughts**: 

I really enjoyed applying my theoretical knowledge onto this mini-project and experimenting through trial and error. I am looking forward to working on more advanced deep learning projects in the future. 

**Possible Future work**: 

Presenting the results data and graphs in my vuejs portfolio.

### Day 6: July 17th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Performed further readings on machine learning, deep learning and artificial intelligence. Gained a clearer understanding over their differences. Checked out Kaggle's learning resources.

### Day 7: July 18th, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 

Started working on the freecodecamp project "book recommendation system" using KNN. Learned the importance and value of cleaning the data and manipulating it for the desired model.

### Day 8: July 20th, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

 Created a calendar for all of the things that I would like to work on. Read about pandas and data analysis techniques to be able to continue working on the project I started, as it required alot of data manipulation before creating the model. I used Kaggle's learning resources to practice data manipulation and ML application.

**Thoughts**: 

I was overwhelmed by the amount of things I wanted to work on and learn, so I decided to list out all of the resources I would like to check-out, and the things I wanted to do. Then, I organized them in themes to cover the most out of them throughout this challenge. I hope this will provide me a a more precise outlook on what I will be working on, and an assertive perspective on my daily accomplishments. We got this!
